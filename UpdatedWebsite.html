<h2> Introduction to SECCM</h2>
		<p>	Scanning Electrochemical Microsopy (SECCM) was first introduced by P.R Unwin and coworkers in 2010, SECCM utilizes a glass nano- or micropipette with a meniscus at the tip that forms a mobile nano- or micro- electrochemical cell. The technique has been applied to mapping topography, electrochemical activity, and conductance of a wide range of heterogenous surfaces with high spatial resolution. </p>

  <div class="desc"> SECCM builds on the double-barreled micro- or nanopipette idea by combining it with simultaneous electrochemical measurements whose area is defined by the contact area of the mobile electrochemical cell meniscus formed at the end of the pipette contacting the substrate. SECCM exploits the possibility of controlling the bias potential between the QRCEs on each side of the double-barreled pipette to control mass transport.</div>

  <div class="desc">SECCM approach curves of dc conductance current and the ac component are a function of z-piezoelectric extension toward the substrate. Three regions are identified: in air, when the meniscus has not yet established contact with the substrate; jump-to-contact (dashed line); and contact. Once the meniscus makes contact with the substrate, current is measured (iac).</div>
